This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Developer Experience
This file uses ![BEMIT naming conventions](https://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/) which help organize the code into a readable and modular structure.
